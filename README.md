# Worldwise (React + Vite)

To run the frontend, use the following command:

### npm run dev

This will start the development server and you can access the project in your web browser at http://localhost:5173/.

Then, you need to install JSON server globally on your system using the following command:

### npm install -g json-server

Start the JSON server by running the following command:

### json-server --watch data/cities.json --port 9000

Please note that json server needs to be run in Git Bash and not on powershell. Otherwise it will throw error.
